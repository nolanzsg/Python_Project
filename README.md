Link Prediction Analysis of Social Networks Based on Massive Data
• Conducted research on social networks analysis based on cell phone call logs to predict social relationships between users
• Proposed a neighbor affinity measure that successfully improved the prediction accuracy and maintained a low computational complexity
• Developed an effective sampling strategy that ameliorated the inadequate training issue of traditional link prediction methods which increased prediction accuracy by 18.10%
